  <h1>ReptileWiki</h1>
  <p>ReptileWiki is a web-based app/ social media platform that tracks the details and history of individual reptiles so that potential buyers can be informed of the condition of the specific reptile that they are buying. Users can search for a specific reptile or no reptile in particular, and view that reptile's history. Users can also share their collection on their profile for others to view, and post status updates to their profile that other users can read. This can be updates about reptiles, information or care advice, or something else.</p>
  
  <h2>Functions of the App</h2>
  <p>This app aims to fulfill 2 purposes: enabling users to purchase reptiles in a safer way by tracking history and verifying breeders, and creating a community of reptile enthusiasts that promote truthful information.</p>
  
  <h2>History Tracking and Breeder Verification</h2>
  
  <h3>Guaranteeing the Condition of a Reptile</h3>
  <p>Options when acquiring a reptile include:<p/>
  <ul>
      <li>Buying from a shop, such as Pets at Home or a local reptile shop</li>
      <li>Buying from a breeder online, or at a reptile expo</li>
      <li>Rescuing or adopting a reptile from a previous owner</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All 3 of these options, especially the last 2, do not guarantee the condition of the reptile that is being bought. It could have underlying health issues, been kept in unsuitable conditions, or could have been imported rather than captive bred. This app documents the owner history and health history of the reptile so that the condition can be guaranteed when buying. The history of a reptile could include:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Origin of the reptile (Store-bought, captive-bred, wild-caught, details of the breeder)</li>
      <li>All previous owners</li>
      <li>Previous vet visits</li>
      <li>Previous/current health issues</li>
      <li>Previous/current medication</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The owner would be responsible for updating the history of the reptile.</p>
  
  <h3>Ensuring Trustworthiness of a Breeder</h3>
  <p>When buying a reptile from a breeder, the term 'reputable' is thrown around. Ensuring a breeder is reputable is completely up the the buyer. This is a problem because the reputation of the breeder is often only understood within the reptile community, and a first-time buyer may not have the same knowledge and understanding as members of this community. This app aims to verify breeders based on reviews by other users, and their activity within the app.</p>
  
  <h2>Reptile Community and Promoting Truthful Information</h2>
  
  <h3>Following Users/ Sharing Personal Collections</h3>
  <p>Each user can have a collection of reptiles they own, available for anyone to view on their profile. This could be like an individual's page on Instagram. Each individual reptile would have a history, some general information about that reptile, and any updates the owner has posted that are about that reptile.</p>
  
  <h3>Posting a Status Update</h3>
  <p>Users can post an update to their profile which would appear in a feed much like Instagram. These posts can be a result of adding a new reptile, posting care
  advice or whatever the user wants to post. In the case of care advice, misinformation could be an issue, like on all other social media platforms.</p>
  
  <h3>Being a Trustworthy Information Source</h3>
  
  <p>There are existing social media platforms and information sources for reptile keepers of varying trustworthiness. These include Facebook groups and forums. Due to the amount of information sources available, misinformation is easily spread and reputable information that is backed by scientific studies is often overlooked. This is most prevalent in Facebook groups, where members often enter the groups with inadequate setups caused by shopkeepers or websites offering bad advice. This app aims to be a single trustworthy source of information.</p>
  
  <p>Trustworthiness of information in the hobby depends on proof from scientific studies and experience. This is why well-known individuals are well-known - because they have proven their trustworthiness over time through their extensive experience, expertise and by proving the information they give. The way this app will promote trustworthiness will be through a user-rating system, and a group of verified individuals. Information given or promoted by verified individuals will be given a higher priority than information given by non-verified users. Also, information given that has a higher rating will be given priority over information that is not rated or has a lower rating. This approach is inspired by the study:</p>
